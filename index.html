                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                 My birthday is June 2, 2005 and I was born in Dubai and lived there until the age of 5. In 2009 my family and I immigrated here for a better future. I have one older sister and one older brother
                 
                 
                <h2>Dreams for the future</h2>
                </p>
                I aspire to become a full-time software engineer in the future and startup a business along the way. 
                
                <h2>What made you start towards this career choice?</h2>
                </p>
                My older brother is a computer engineering graduate and he always had a passion for computer programming at a young age. As a child younger then him, my parents encouraged me to pursue the same career he did, so I did some computer science classes throughout high school. Fortunately, I really liked the classes and found them engaging so I decided to pursue a tech-based degree here at York University.
                
               
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                </p>
                My hobbies during the school year are to study coding languages like Java and Python. My non-educational hobbies are basketball, hanging out with friends, soccer, and going on bike rides.
